# Risk Assessment & Uncertainty Analysis Toolkit

**Versions:** Excel (VBA) + Python (Automation)

A dual-version software suite for CAPEX/OPEX uncertainty analysis and process risk modeling — built to accelerate decision-making and improve cost visibility across engineering projects.

---

## Purpose

* Quantify uncertainty in capital and operating costs
* Identify key cost drivers through sensitivity analysis
* Enable faster, data-driven decision-making in Pre-FEED & FEED phases

---

## Toolkit Overview

### Excel Monte Carlo Tool (VBA-Based)

* Interactive UI with input ranges (mean, min, max, std dev)
* Real-time charts (histograms, tornado plots)
* 85% faster analysis time (10 min ➝ \~90 sec)
* Lightweight and accessible for quick assessments

### Python Automation Tool

* Integrates with:

  * **Aspen Plus / HYSYS models**
  * **Excel-based costing sheets**
  * **First-principles engineering equations**
* Automates:

  * Monte Carlo simulation
  * Sensitivity analysis
  * Scenario generation
* Reduces manual work by 90%
